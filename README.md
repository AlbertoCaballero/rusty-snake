# Rust Snake

A snake game written in Rust.

## How To Build It ?

Download Rust compiler from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), change the working directory to the root of this project, then execute the following command:

```
> cargo build
```

The executable binary will appear in `target/debug`, called `rust-snake.exe`.

## TODOs

- ~~To randomly generate foods~~
- ~~To make the snake move itself~~
- ~~To make the snake die when it hits itself~~
- ~~To make the snake die when it hits borders~~
- ~~To make the game restart after the snake dies~~
- To have a better game-over screen

## Bugs

- ~~Foods should not be shown up on top of the snake~~
